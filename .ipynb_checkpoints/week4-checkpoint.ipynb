    "## ðŸ“Š Analysis: AI-Suggested vs. Manual Sorting Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI-suggested function, `sort_dicts_by_key`, leverages Pythonâ€™s built-in `sorted()` function, which internally uses **Timsort**â€”a highly efficient hybrid sorting algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. This function is concise, expressive, and easy to read, making it ideal for real-world production environments. It also preserves flexibility through the `key` parameter, allowing custom sorting strategies without requiring boilerplate logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the manually implemented `sort_dicts_by_key_manual` employs **bubble sort**, which is conceptually simple but computationally inefficient with a time complexity of **O(nÂ²)**. While it serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding basic sorting mechanics, itâ€™s unsuitable for performance-critical applications or large datasets due to its poor scalability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both implementations yield accurate results on small collections, the AI-suggested code clearly excels in terms of **speed, readability, and robustness**. Moreover, it minimizes the likelihood of bugs caused by nested loops and manual data swapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the AI-assisted approach not only ensures efficiency but also upholds Pythonic best practices. It demonstrates how AI-powered tools can enhance developer productivity and guide engineers toward clean, reliable, and production-ready code without sacrificing control or precision.\n"
