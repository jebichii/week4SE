## Proposal: LegacyLens — AI-Powered Codebase Understanding Assistant

### 🛠 Problem Addressed

One of the biggest hurdles in modern software engineering is **understanding large, undocumented legacy systems**. Engineers spend hours deciphering old code with little to no documentation, which leads to high onboarding time, fragile refactors, and duplicate logic.

### 🎯 Purpose

**LegacyLens** is an AI assistant that reverse-engineers complex legacy codebases into understandable maps, diagrams, and summaries. It accelerates comprehension, refactoring, and documentation by providing semantic overviews and logic flow insights of existing code.

### ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Codebase Analysis**  
   - Scans through legacy code repositories (e.g. COBOL, C, Python, Java).
   - Performs static and semantic analysis to detect modules, dependencies, and inheritance chains.

2. **Flow & Feature Mapping**  
   - Visualizes control and data flow.
   - Groups code by functional purpose (e.g., UI logic, DB access, business rules).

3. **Natural Language Summarization**  
   - Generates concise module-level summaries (e.g., “This class performs customer lookup using cached records”).
   - Provides traceable “explanation threads” that walk devs through what happens from input to output.

4. **Refactor Suggestions**  
   - Highlights duplicate or dead code.
   - Offers structure recommendations (e.g., extract method, convert to class, remove unreachable logic).

5. **Collaboration Hooks**  
   - Integrates with IDEs and GitHub/GitLab.
   - Enables devs to ask: “What does this function do?” or “Where is payment status updated?”

### 🌍 Potential Impact

- **Saves Weeks of Reverse Engineering**: Useful for onboarding, audits, and modernization.
- **Improves Quality**: Safer refactoring with better context.
- **Preserves Institutional Knowledge**: Captures logic that exists only in developer memory.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Business analysts and junior engineers can navigate legacy systems confidently.
